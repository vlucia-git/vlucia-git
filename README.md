🎮 Game Designer in the making | Premium Bug Developer 🛠️

Hey! I'm Lúcia, a trans woman passionate about creating worlds, telling stories, and making players scream in frustration (but in a fun way, I promise!).

👾 I love games—classic and modern alike—and I'm diving into the world of game design and development.
💡 My ideas are a mix of sci-fi, horror, and just a little bit of chaos.
🐞 Bugs? I prefer to call them "unexpected features."

If you love games, coffee, and weird theories about game mechanics, let's chat! 🚀
